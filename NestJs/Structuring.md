# Structuring Nestjs Projects: Best Practices and Example

 NestJS is a framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications using TypeScript. The structure might vary based on the specific requirements of your project, but a well-organized project structure is crucial for building robust and maintainable applications. In this guide, weâ€™ll explore the best practices for structuring NestJS projects.

 Usually, NestJS architecture is based on the following features:
 - Controllers
 - Modules
 - Services

 All the above features are organized in a modular way. This means that a module in NestJS serves as a container for organizing and encapsulating different parts of your application

## Explanation:

- **src**: This is the main source code directory.
    - **app**: The main module of your application.
        - **controllers**: Controllers handle incoming requests and return responses.
        - **modules**: Different modules of your application. Each module can have its **controllers**, services, and other components.
        - **services**: Business logic and data manipulation are handled by services.
    - **config**: Configuration files for your application.
    - **dto**: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for defining the structure of data passed between different layers of your application.
    - **middleware**: Custom middleware for processing requests before they reach the controllers.
    - **entities**: Database entities or data models for interacting with databases.
    - **filters**: Custom exception filters for handling exceptions globally.
    - **guards**: Authorization guards for controlling access to routes.
    - **interceptors**: Interceptors can be used to modify the request/response objects globally.
    - **pipes**: Pipes are used to transform the data coming into the application.
- **main.ts**: The entry point of your application where you bootstrap NestJS.

- **app.controller.spec.ts, app.service.spec.ts, etc.**: Unit test files for your controllers, services, and other components.

- **README.md**: Documentation for your project.

- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration file.

- **package.json**: Node.js package file with dependencies and scripts.
